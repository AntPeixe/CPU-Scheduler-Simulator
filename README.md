# **CPU Scheduler Simulation in C**

Project developed for a university assignment, it's main focus was to simulate the 5 state model of a CPU and it's memory.

Both the project report and the comments in the code are written in Portuguese. The project description is also in Portuguese and contains the type of instructions this CPU would read.

# *Conditions*
- The input file (input.xpto) must be carefully made because the program expects to have free space in (the "virtual") memory to allocate the "program" that arrives to the CPU.
